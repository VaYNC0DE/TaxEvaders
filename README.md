# (FALL 2023) TaxEvaders - SPYN project

A collection of our code used to develop the EV3 Robot project named **SPYN**.

The main code includes all the logic that is required to control the robot. It calls upon the file KeyboardMotor.m to allow manual control of the robot when the color sensor comes across a color block. 

**!(This project is now complete.)!**
